This app fetches the data from the substitution-plan website of my school and displays it in a generic list. You can also tell the app which grade you are in, and it will automatically push the information associated with your grade to the top. The website of my school does only display a few entries of the plan per page and you must wait a few seconds until it loads the next page, so I decided to create a project which improves the user experience by loading all pages at once and letting the user decide what he wants to see. The website of my school does by the way look awful what my app also corrects.

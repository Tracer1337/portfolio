Pathfinding algorithms are used to find the shortest path between two or more nodes in a graph. This website visualizes the behavior of different pathfinding algorithms and lets you place barriers to interact with them. It uses a grid of square cells which can be customized in size and it also provides a few rendering methods in 2D as well as 3D. You can even tweak a few settings which will change the behavior of some algorithms. I made this project for educational purposes only, since learning-by-doing is mostly the best way to go when learning a new technology.

With this application you can track your activities throughout a day, and it creates statistics and graphs based on the data. You can create activities and assign categories to them, and assign tags to activities and categories. This project is for personal use only and I therefor made it [open source](https://github.com/Tracer1337/activitiy-analyzer). It helps me to be more productive and prevents me from spending too much time on watching Netflix or doing other useless things.

This platform makes it super easy to manage competitions and submit projects to them. It offers a role- and level-system as well as a discord bot which integrates the level-system and notifications into any discord guild. A user can register himself on the platform via discords OAuth and will then receive a role for his level on any guild he has in common with the discord bot. I made this project for a web-development discord forum where competitions are controlled manually.

This boilerplate contains an express backend with a ready-to-use folder structure. It comes with a lightweight, custom ORM, and some predefined scripts to, for example, deploy the application to a server. For the frontend it comes with react to be used as an SPA, and material-ui for UI components. Some major libraries like redux for state management and axios for communicating with the backend are also preinstalled and already set up. I created this package because I use the same technologies in all of my projects and I do not want to set up everything from scratch every time I make a new one.

This is a website, where anyone can create an account and publish posts or write comments. It uses a completely unnecessary SPA in the frontend which looks terrible, but the benefit of using this technology is, that the website is able to cache all requests for a smoother user experience. The custom blog system I wrote for it is the same crap as every existing blog system out there. After I published the project, I had the motivation to write a few posts, but I quickly came to the conclusion that writing a blog is not so much fun as I imagined it to be, so there will not be any new post in the future.

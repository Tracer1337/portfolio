MeArm v0.4 is an [open source project](https://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Sized-Robot-Arm-meArm-V04/) (not from me), which contains the 3d models for all the parts to build a robotic arm. The preferred way of building the parts is by using a CNC machine, but I printed them with my 3d printer which also works great. I used a Raspberry Pi to control the arm, and the wiring is documented on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Tracer1337/MeArmRaspi) where you can also find a web server, which will provide a user interface and an API to control the arm. I made this project because I wanted to build something with my 3d printer, and an interactive project is always more fun than just printing a static figure.

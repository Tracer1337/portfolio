This timer reads an Excel file containing all exercises of a workout and displays them in a panel on the left side. When you click the "Start Workout" button, the website starts off by showing the name of your first exercise and creates a timer with the duration associated with it. After each exercise a sound appears and the pause begins, if specified in the spreadsheet. The intention behind this project was to create a large timer which covers the entire screen, since I do my workouts without glasses and cannot see small numbers on a screen when being too far away.

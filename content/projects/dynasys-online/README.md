This project is based on the [DynaSys simulation software](https://www.hupfeld-software.de/dokuwiki/doku.php/dynasys), which is used to create and simulate dynamic systems, as my computer science teacher said. The problem with this program is, it was developed in the 90s and therefor looks terrible. It also has a few bugs, why I decided to re-create this project and build a web-based version of it. My application implements the same core features as the original program while it looks better and has an overall better user experience.
